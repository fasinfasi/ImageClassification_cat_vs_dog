## Plan
- Load and preprocess images
- Train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
- Evaluate and Save the model
- Build a Flask API to accept image uploads
- Build a simple frontend UI to upload image
- Deploy using Docker and Cloud server

## Folder Structure
- `data/` → raw dataset
- `models/` → saved models
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks
- `app/` → Backend + Frontend code
- `docker/` → Docker files
